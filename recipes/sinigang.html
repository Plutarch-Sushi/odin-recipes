        <h2>Description:</h2>
        </div>
        <p>A true Filipino dish can be traced back even before the spanish came to the Philippines, as suggested by food historians it origins are most likely indigenous hence there is no 
            documentation of what and where the origin of sinigang is. It's believed to have originated in the Philippines during the pre-colonial era. The indigenous people of the Philippines
            have been using tamarind as a souring agent for their dishes for centuries. It's likely that the dish evolved over time, with different regions and ethnic groups putting their own spin
            on it. Sinigang is more than just a dish, it's an integral part of the Filipino culture.
        </p>
        <p>Sinigang is a staple dish in Filipino cuisine and it is known for its sour and savory taste. One of the things that makes Sinigang unique is the use of tamarind as a souring agent.
            It rouses the senses because of the sourness and slight spice. You can serve it with rice and it is a complete meal of its own. There are, of course, different ways to prepare it and has
            a lot of variations like sinigang na hipon, sinigang na isda, and sinigang sa pakwan.
