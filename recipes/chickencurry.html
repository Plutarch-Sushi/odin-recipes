    </div>
        <p>Filipino Chicken Curry is rooted in Indian cuisine, which was introduced to the Philippines during ancient trade routes. Spices such as turmeric, cumin, coriander, and cardamom entered the
            local culinary scene. These aromatic ingredients formed the foundation for what woule eventually become one of Filipinos' favorite comfort foods. As with any traditional dish, Filipino cooks
            have always put their unique spin on recipes passed down through generations. To adapt curry to local palates, Filipinos added coconut milk for creaminess and sweetness while reducing the spice
            levels slightly compared to its Indian counterparts.</p>
        <p>Every home cook has Pinoy-style chicken curry in their reportoire. The dish bears the DNA of Ginataang manok but what transforms it from ginataang manok to chicken curry is, curry powder.
            It is a dish that is earthy, spicy, warming, or even sometimes sweet. It is a well-balanced, richly spiced dish with notes of deep savory flavors from some of the ingredients like fish 
            sauce, coconut milk, and evaporated milk. Preparation time can take up to 10 minutes while the cooking time can take up to 20 - 30 minutes. </p>
