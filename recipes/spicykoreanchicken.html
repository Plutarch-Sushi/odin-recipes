        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p> Over the past few years, Korean culture has been making waves worldwide and will continue to rise in the next few years. Aside from the popularity of K-pop, K-dramas, and movies, many people are starting to love and crave Korean food as well, particularly Korean fried chicken.
            Korean fried chicken is crunchy, crispy, and covered in various sauces of your choosing. Some flavors are spicy like this recipe while others are covered in delicious umami sesame and soy sauce flavors, and some kind of sweet sauce. The concept of fried chicken was first introduced 
            to Korea when the American Millitary set foot and stationed on Korean soil during the Korean War in the late 1940s. The US troops that were stationed in Korea during thanksgiving only had chicken instead of turkey to celebrate. </p>
            <p>Spicy Korean chicken is unique in the sense that it is known for being double-fried. It is first fried in a low temperature and then fried at a higher temperature, giving the chicken a crispy texture that is loved by many. This Korean-style chicken dish is packed with bold and spicy flavors.</p>

                <li>1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 inch ginger, minced</li>
                <li>2 tablespoon sugar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
                <li>4 tablespoon gochujang</li>
                <li>toasted sesame seeds or crushed toasted peanuts</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prep:</strong> Preheat the oven to 250 Fahrenheit (120 Celsius). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Insert a wire rack into the lined baking sheet and brush it with oil to prevent sticking. </li>
                <li><strong>Prepare chicken wings:</strong> Pat dry and toss chicken wings with baking powder and salt to coat. Arrange the wings on the wire rack, and make sure they don’t touch each other. </li>
                <li><strong>Bake the wings:</strong>  Bake using the lower rack in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Increase the temperature to 425 Fahrenheit (220 Celsius), transfer the wings to an upper rack, and continue baking for another 45 minutes, or until the wings are golden brown and crispy.</li>
                <li><strong>Cook gochujang sauce:</strong> Sauté garlic and ginger until fragrant in a large frying pan/wok over medium heat, about 3 minutes. Add remaining sauce ingredients and cook on low heat for 3 minutes. Turn the heat off but let the frying pan/wok sits on the stove’s heat sauce to keep it warm.</li>
                <li><strong>Coat chicken wings:</strong> Remove fried chicken wings from the oven, add them to the cooked sauce and gently toss to coat them evenly.</li>
                <li><strong>Garnish and serve: </strong> Transfer the wings to a serving plate and sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds or crushed peanuts. Serve the chicken wings immediately with some cold beer.</li>
            </ol>
